  <h1>Part 1: Foundations of Cancer</h1>

  <h2>What is Cancer?</h2>
  <p>
    Cancer is a group of diseases marked by uncontrolled cell growth and the ability of abnormal cells to invade nearby tissues and spread (metastasize) to distant organs. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells bypass growth control signals, resist cell death, and keep dividing without limit. These cells develop a set of traits known as the hallmarks of cancer (Roizen, 2012). These hallmarks include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sustaining proliferative signaling: Cancer cells grow and divide without depending on normal growth signals.</li>
    <li>Evading growth suppressors: They ignore signals that usually slow down or stop cell division.</li>
    <li>Resisting cell death: They avoid apoptosis, which normally removes damaged or unneeded cells.</li>
    <li>Inducing angiogenesis: They form new blood vessels to supply oxygen and nutrients to the tumor.</li>
    <li>Enabling replicative immortality: They divide indefinitely, unlike normal cells that stop after a certain point.</li>
    <li>Activating invasion and metastasis: They spread to other parts of the body beyond the original site.</li>
    <li>Reprogramming cellular metabolism: They change their metabolism to support continuous growth.</li>
    <li>Evading immune destruction: They hide from or resist attacks by the immune system.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
     These features work together to make cancer cells aggressive, hard to control, and capable of spreading in the body (Roizen, 2012).
  </p>
         
  <h2>Cell Cycle and its Regulation</h2>
  <h3>a. Overview of the Cell Cycle</h3>
  <p>
    The cell cycle is a series of stages that a cell goes through as it grows and divides. It begins with the G1 phase (Gap 1), where the cell grows and actively synthesizes proteins and organelles. During this phase, the cell also prepares for DNA replication. At a critical decision point, the cell either continues into the next phase (S phase) or exits the cycle and enters a resting state known as the G0 phase. In G0, the cell stops dividing. Some cells, like neurons, remain in G0 permanently, while others, such as liver cells, may reenter the cycle when needed (Sherr, 2000).  

    If the cell continues through the cycle, it enters the S phase (Synthesis phase), where DNA replication occurs and each chromosome is duplicated. After DNA synthesis, the cell enters the G2 phase (Gap 2). In this phase, the cell prepares for mitosis by continuing to grow and producing additional proteins and organelles (Sherr, 2000).

    Finally, the cell enters the M phase (Mitosis phase). This phase involves the division of the nucleus, called karyokinesis, followed by the division of the cytoplasm, known as cytokinesis. The result is two genetically identical daughter cells, each ready to begin a new cycle (Sherr, 2000).</p>
  <h3>b. Key Regulatory Proteins and Complexes</h3>
  <p>
    Cyclins and CDKs regulate the cycle by phosphorylating proteins needed for progression (Sherr, 2000; Knudsen et al., 2022):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cyclin D–CDK4/6: G1 phase</li>
    <li>Cyclin E–CDK2: G1/S transition</li>
    <li>Cyclin A–CDK2: S phase</li>
    <li>Cyclin B–CDK1: G2/M transition</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Checkpoints in the Cell Cycle</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>G1/S Checkpoint:</strong> Blocks cycle if DNA is damaged; p53 activates p21 to inhibit CDKs; Rb suppresses E2F (Sherr, 2000; Duffy et al., 2011).</li>
    <li><strong>Intra-S Checkpoint:</strong> Temporarily pauses DNA synthesis upon damage.</li>
    <li><strong>G2/M Checkpoint:</strong> Ensures complete and accurate DNA replication; CHK1/CHK2 kinases involved.</li>
    <li><strong>Spindle Assembly Checkpoint:</strong> Prevents anaphase until chromosomes are properly attached (Sherr, 2000).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tumor Suppressors and Oncogenes in Cell Cycle Regulation</h2>
  <h3>a. Tumor Suppressors</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>p53:</strong> Pauses cycle, induces senescence/apoptosis upon damage (Duffy et al., 2011).</li>
    <li><strong>Rb:</strong> Inhibits early entry into S phase by controlling E2F (Sherr, 2000).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>b. Oncogenes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cyclin D1:</strong> Overexpressed in breast cancer and lymphomas (Finn et al., 2009).</li>
    <li><strong>CDK4/6:</strong> Upregulated in glioblastomas and melanomas (Finn et al., 2009).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cell Cycle Dysregulation in Cancer</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Loss of p53:</strong> Over 50% of cancers lack p53, causing unchecked damaged cell survival (Duffy et al., 2011).</li>
    <li><strong>Overactive CDK4/6:</strong> Promotes early S phase entry by hyperphosphorylating Rb (Sherr, 2000).</li>
    <li><strong>Excess Cyclin D:</strong> Accelerates G1 progression, common in breast and lymphatic cancers (Finn et al., 2009).</li>
  </ul>
